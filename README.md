# Credit Risk Analysis Report

# The purpose of this analysis is to create and evaluate the accuracy of a data model that predicts the credity worthiness of potential borrowers from peer-to-peer lending services

# * Balanced Accuracy Score: 95.20%
# When taking into account the sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) of the model, the balanced prediction accuracy was 95.2%
# * Precision Score: 92%
# The model can predict true positives correctly 92% of the time and 8% of preicted positives are false
# * Recall Score: 95%
# The model was 95% precise in measuring true positive values out of all the positive values to be found

# I would recommend using this model to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers, because it has over 95% accuracy in predicting the outcome of the repayment of the initial loan.
